# OCR Demo

This code implements an OCR approach of characters recognition.

It was decided to use OCR engine instead of implementation from scratch.
Tesseract is used as an OCR engine. It provides suitable API and already pre-trained models
for both simplified and traditional Chinese.

To pre-process the images OpenCV library is used.
